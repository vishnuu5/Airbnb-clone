## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later recommended)
- `npm` (comes with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (you can use a local instance or a cloud-hosted one like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vishnuu5/Airbnb-clone.git
    cd the-gen-task
    ```
    (Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username if you forked it)

2.  **Setup Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` directory. This file will store your environment variables.
    ```
    # .env file for backend

    # Server port
    PORT=5000

    # MongoDB Connection URI
    MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>

    # JWT Secret for token signing
    JWT_SECRET=<your_super_secret_jwt_key>
    ```
    Replace the placeholder values with your actual MongoDB connection string and a secure JWT secret key.

3.  **Setup Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
    The frontend is configured to proxy API requests to the backend server running on `localhost:5000`. No special `.env` configuration is needed for it to connect to the backend out-of-the-box.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Open a terminal, navigate to the `/backend` directory, and run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    Open a *second* terminal, navigate to the `/frontend` directory, and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The React application should now be running and will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
